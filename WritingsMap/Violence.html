        December 15th 2024
        <p>
            To say that the murder of Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, last week on December 4th caused a great deal of commotion is an understatement. The media and the internet have been awash with discussions, theories, glorifications, and memes. However, I won't delve too deeply into the debate about whether this action was moral or justified, whether he has a point, or the debate about how incredibly attractive Luigi is and whether that makes everything right. Instead, I want to address the idea that violence is necessary for change in today's (Western) world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unsurprisingly, the internet immediately launched an investigation after Luigi Mangione's name was released. Among other things, an Amazon review of the manifesto by Theodore Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, surfaced (see attachment).
        </p>
        <p>
            First, I noticed that the media and the internet frequently link Mangione to Kaczynski. I'm fairly familiar with the Unabomber case, and the only significant similarity I can draw is that they both used murder as a means and had a manifesto. Beyond that, they differ fundamentally. For example, Kaczynski held a much more radical view that the average person considered insane, while Mangione's disdain for American health insurance, not surprisingly, has broad support. Moreover, Kaczynski, like the misanthrope he was, had contempt for everyone, including (left-wing) activists, and targeted civilians as well. Just think of the failed attacks on passenger planes. Mangione, on the other hand, deliberately targeted those he believed were perpetrators of what he abhorred.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what struck me most was that this review alone provides a tremendous insight into Mangione's decision to turn to violence. In his review, Mangione quotes a piece—which he found an interesting point—that argues that only violence can bring about change and ensure that people are listened to. Kaczynski supposedly proved this; oil barons never listened to environmental activists, but feared the Unabomber. Corporations are destroying the world, peaceful protest is ignored, and economic protest is impossible in the current system. Violence justified as self-defense is therefore the last resort, as Luigi himself quotes: “When all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive.”
        </p>
        <p>
            It's of course easy to quote a big hot take, as Mangione does here. Strictly speaking, he didn't argue it himself; he simply found it an interesting point. But quoting this in the context of the rest of the review, coupled with the fact that he himself, less than a year later, turned to violence, gives me the impression that Mangione strongly agreed with this quote.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mangione isn't the first to see violence and revolution as the way to dispel a particular system or hierarchy; Besides Kaczynski, of course, it's not difficult to draw similarities with (movements in) ideologies like communism or anarchism, and the idea isn't unpopular online.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a sense, I can understand the idea; power has been much less apparent, yet nonetheless strong, for just over a century. In the past, power was concentrated and clearly visible, but now power is hidden in social mechanisms, and it's no longer clear how people are controlled. Protest can easily be ignored, which makes the impression that no form of peaceful protest can achieve anything anymore and that violence is the last resort to overthrow this hidden system seem logical.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I think Mangione and all the others mentioned above have a fundamental misunderstanding. Their ideology always clearly presents an evil antagonist; an institution that prioritizes self-interest, deliberately harms or restricts others, and has created a system of oppression. Think of the bourgeoisie in communism, the state and corporations in anarchism, or health insurance companies for Mangione. However, I consider that, in the views of Mangione and the others mentioned above, these are merely pseudo-antagonists.  There is no group of evil people who deliberately oppress others. There is only a system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Society is sort of possessed by systems. Throughout history, holistic systems have developed within society to which everyone is subject. In these kinds of systems (if there are even multiple ones), there are numerous small parts of society, such as individuals or organizations, each holding a portion of the power. However, "the rest," that is, all the other individuals and organizations, have more power than you do. And precisely when this "rest" moves in a certain direction, an incredibly powerful current is created, consisting of countless small parts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take the most prominent system in the Western world: capitalism. The problem isn't that a select group of capitalists grows rich at the expense of ordinary people; the problem lies in the possibility. In capitalism, profit is the ultimate goal and driving force; this is what creates the current. Humans have a natural urge for domination and power, and this natural impulse is given free rein within capitalism. One can (morally) blame people for moving toward this domination, which in this system is primarily achievable in the largest corporations, but the fact is that such people will always exist, and they will always find themselves in such positions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Capitalism, like many other systems, has no clear organizer but is maintained by everyone individually. Society is saturated with these systems: capitalism is everywhere, technology is everywhere, hierarchy is everywhere, and that is precisely why such systems are difficult to overthrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            With concentrated power, such as a dictator, aristocracy, and so on, a revolution is realistic and has even occurred frequently. But with dispersed power in the form of these kinds of systems, a revolution is simply impossible: it demands a complete transformation of society.
        </p>
        <p>
            Are we then hopelessly stuck with the status quo? Is every protest against these kinds of systems futile from the start? No. Because if we remember where power is dispersed—across individuals and organizations—then the fact that people can change their minds and be influenced is salvation. Systems are maintained by all the small elements, and if these elements are made aware of the system's drawbacks, more and more will resist it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This kind of activism happens frequently, but it requires patience: you don't just change the minds of the majority. Is violence a good means to accelerate this? Certainly not. In fact, although the message does indeed spread more quickly, the ideal would likely attract fewer supporters. After all, anyone who supports the call would also tolerate or at least turn a blind eye to violence. For many, the turn to violence (fortunately) crosses the line, and most people simply won't be so desperate to make an exception. For Mangione it is even worse: he primarily needed government support but if the government agrees with Mangione's motive, it tolerates and indirectly encourages violence, which it will never do. Mangione has sent his ideal to the grave, 
        </p>
        <p>
            Violence achieves nothing in today's world. There's nothing left to revolt against. Power is no longer highly concentrated, but dispersed and hidden. Moreover, using violence to draw attention to a cause is counterproductive. How such a system could possibly be brought down, I don't know. Perhaps only a different system, which doesn't necessarily have to be an economic one, can fundamentally change the situation or, at most, replace the current one. However, I think it's more realistic that the system will gradually improve (partly due to the influence of activists) but I'd call this evolution rather than revolution.
