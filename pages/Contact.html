        <h4>This site</h4>
        <p>
            I have been writing for quite a while now and liked the idea to put some of them online. So, as a project in my spare time I made this website. Apart from some straighforward Python, I'm not very much into programming which you might have noticed.  
            <br><br>
            Although I strive for accuracy, I'm not an expert and will make mistakes here and there. Therefore I <u>consider none of my writings as a reliable source</u>.      </p>
        <h4>Me</h4>
            You can contact me through this email: aramblingsolipsist@proton.me <br><br>
            If you ever find a mistake, please let me know (with a proof please). I'm also open to everything else, whether that is questions, discussion, criticism, death threats or whatever you want. 
            <br><br>
